# Full Stack eCommerce Cart build (React, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB)

I built a full-stack e-commerce cart from scratch using React and Redux for our frontend and Node, Express, and MongoDB for our backend. We will be doing everything on our own from setting up the backend API to styling our components.

# frontend/client </br>

install all the dependencies needed for </br>
npm install</br>
npm start</br>
Runs the app in the development mode.</br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.</br>

# backend/server</br>

install all the dependencies needed for</br>
if you want to use the project, you need to make a new
config.env and put there all that you need for the project to run well
at the same time I left an example.config.env to have more clear how to add it, and finally, it runs well </br>
npm install</br>
npm start</br>
Runs the app in the development mode.</br>
Open http://localhost:5000 to view it in the browser.</br>
